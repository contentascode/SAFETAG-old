tools are only suggestions based upon what works for us. Use whatever makes you feel comfortable.
We are going to be prescriptive, that is just to give you the toolbox. Find another tool, use it, tell us, we will add it as an alternative.
we use external documentation as much as we can. But, most are horribly documented.
