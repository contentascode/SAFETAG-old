### Why It Matters

SAFETAG is an open product and its long term success will be judged by it being a framework that is found to be useful enough to the broader community to spark ongoing peer support and content creation.  Specifically, auditors using the SAFETAG methodologies should feel free to not only submit issues they would like to see improved, but to adapt it to their own needs and submit back any content which could be useful to other auditors.
