### Input

The goal of this step is to have the organization think carefully about where their critical organizational data actually lives, and what protects it in all of the different locations.  The email server may be secured, but does every laptop with email stored on it have an encrypted hard drive? Every smartphone? Who has access to a share dropbox - and who manages who has access?

This exercise is adapted from the LevelUp Activity, [Backup Matrix](https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/activity/backup-matrix), part of the curricula for [Data Retrention and Backup](https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/data-retention-and-backup) by Daniel O'Clunaigh, Ali Ravi, Samir Nassar, and Carol.

This version focuses more on the sensitive data aspects of the exercise, though this remains a powerful visual example of the importance of backups.
