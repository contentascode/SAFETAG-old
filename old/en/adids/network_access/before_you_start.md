### Before You Start

Set up a wireless router just for training purposes with a password known to you and breakable by the password dictionary instructions you have provided.  This allows you to do some of the more aggressive network access steps without disrupting work or being irresponsible.

If no WPA network is available, you can use [this file](http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=wpa-Induction.pcap).

If you are also training on WPS or WEP, Pre-configure a wireless access point to serve those networks as well. The WEP network should be configured to use 64 bit encryption to speed the practice. If no WEP network is available, you can use [this pre-build airodump-ng capture file](http://download.aircrack-ng.org/wiki-files/other/test.ivs) and skip the airodump-ng capture.
