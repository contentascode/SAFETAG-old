### Activity

An ice-breaker activity, like "Two Truths and a Lie" (https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/icebreakers-energizers) or one where each trainee shares a "secret" (that they are ok with having the other trainees figure out) and the group tries to match secrets to people, can help open the discussion around resetting and refreshing one's own assumptions.
