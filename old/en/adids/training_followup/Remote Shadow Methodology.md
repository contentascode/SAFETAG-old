While the collaborative audit process provides rich interaction, additional training opportunities, and good feedback both to improve the SAFETAG training process and the audit framework itself, sending a senior auditor is not always possible due to cost, time, and security limitations.

In these situations, a "remote" collaboration draft method is detailed below, to accommodate even in drastic time-zone differences.

### Operational Security

In traditional collaborative audits, the organization gets to connect directly with the senior auditor.  This connection is lacking in the remote method, and the auditors need to respect this challenge.  This adds complexity to the interaction, and requires the auditors to very carefully exchange the highly sensitive data of the audit process, as well as set up expectations amongst themselves and for the organization on who has access to the data.

It is impossible to guarantee these processes (the remote auditor can, once they have access, technically do anything with the data), so the client is putting a lot of trust into the auditors, and the auditors must be flexible in adapting to their concerns.

Data sharing:

* context research / interview notes sharing
* nmap and vulnerability scan results
* cropped packet captures of interest
* photos of critical data, process mapping, other staff activity outputs

Daily check-ins:

* Discuss documents from previous work
* Review the process, challenges, adaptations of the current day
* Share documents of the current day, with any specific notes for the mentor to look at.
* Discuss the plan for the next day and the overall audit cycle progress
