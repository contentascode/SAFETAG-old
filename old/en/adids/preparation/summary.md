### Summary

The capacity assessment, context research and remote assessment activities all should feed into the auditor's preparation for travel.  This may mean researching or refreshing their skillset on a particular tool or operating system or packing a different piece of hardware -- or leaving one behind.

In addition to this, the auditor should also be preparing a password cracking dictionary if they intend to demonstrate the problems of insecure wireless networks.

Finally, any specific travel considerations (visa needs, etc.) should not fall through the cracks.
