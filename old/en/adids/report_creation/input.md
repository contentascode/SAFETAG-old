### Input

#### Reports

 Who are the audiences for the report? 
  * funders, technologists, board of directors, partners, new staff, etc
 


Writing the report in a modular enough way for components to be read alone and acted upon

 * Technical sections without risk modeling (added to the appendix)
 * exec summary not exposing vulnerabilities
 * The larger narrative component; including Charts and graphs
 * The Road Map


A report needs to clearly communicating the path between recommendations and the security requirements that were expressed during the asset and processes audit.

  * Documenting the threat modeling process
    * Showing threat processes

* Quantifying risk based of threat process
  * Estimated Loss per incident
  * Estimated probility of Event
  * Technical vs. Managerial vs. Staff Level report

Splitting up report items by the "ability for data to be used in an attack" so that an overview of needs and how to resolve them can be articulated to key external gorups (board and funders, etc.) without unduely increasing the risk of attack to the organization if intercepted will be vital for getting the support they need.
