### Input

The debrief section is an important final-day collection of activities, depending on the needs of the organization.  At the very least, the debrief should allow you to summarize your work, any core findings, and plan with your key contacts for the next steps (e.g. how will the securely receive and store the report you will send them?)

In addition, the "debrief" should provide some amount of psycho-social care to the organization and the auditor should expect to answer questions about how the audit went.

Depending on the immediate findings, it may be prudent to provide a spot training or awareness-raisng activity around core concepts or tools. If you determine a spot-training may be necessary, consult [Level Up](https://www.level-up.cc/) for sample curricula and exercises.

It is very important to avoid the "Friday at 5pm tweak problem" -- as discussed at the outset, the SAFETAG auditor should not be "fixing" tech problems, especially on the very last day.  Obviously, there are extreme cases where this is the responsible thing to do, but the reality is that the auditor does not have the sufficient time or understanding of potentially inter-related processes to safely change/fix settings, and may not be available to support them afterwards.

This however is a prime time to discuss the coming report, and how it will include a suggested roadmap of changes alongside the types of support and expertise these changes will need and additional resources where available.

Finally, the auditor should discuss their availability around post-assessment care and consulting, as well as the timeline for the report and post-report check-ins.
