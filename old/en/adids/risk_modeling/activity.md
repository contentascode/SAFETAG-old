### Activity

Auditors are provided basic information about an organization and a basic assessment plan for that organization for an audit (use the Sample Org in Appendix A).  After a short time looking it over they will each be given a persona to become as "employees" for that organization. The trainer will then run a quick critical process mapping activity with the "staff."
