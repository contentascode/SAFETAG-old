  * Holistic Security Audits
	* Contextual security assessment
	  * What does the organization feel are the important parts of their work?
	  * What does safety mean to the organization, its staff, and its community?
	  * What are they concerned about with respect to their security?
        * Addressing physical, digital, perceptual, emotional, psycho-social, and other vulnerabilities.
  * Needs Assessment Activities
    * Facilitation Tips
      * Having the right people in the room
	  * Room setup
    * Process Mapping
	  * Determine the boundaries
	    * "As Is" not "Should Be" for describing processes
	  * Identify processes that allow an organization to "do their work"
	    * These should include as many processes as possible
	  * Determine critical processes
	    * Not just critical processes for management. Should have wide interest among staff to build investment later and show that they impact all staff at the organization.
	  * Document the events within those processes
	    * Brainstorm every step in the sequence of activities that make up a process
		* Identify where the various steps in a process "take place"
		  * In at a coffee shop, in e-mail, in XMPP chat, in the office, 
	    * Place those on a board and create a "collaboration graph with all the people involved"
		  * Have one or two people write and everyone else shout to ensure no repeats
    * Asset Identification
	  * Identify the assets they are reliant on within each process
	    * A conversation is an asset, as is an e-mail
		* A document or other digital file is an asset
		* An individual person or a relationship between two people is an asset.
	  * Identify technology used in each process
		* The services or devices you use to connect conversations, hold data, or manage relationships are also assets.
	    * Storage & transfer of data and communication
        * Identify who has access to those assets.
		  * Who has the originals
		  * Who has password access to the devices or services
		  * What is their relationship to the organization
    * Risk Assessment
	  * Identifying Risks:
	    * If unauthorized individuals find out an asset/process.
	      * Confidentiality is keeping assets or knowledge about assets away from unauthorized parties.
	    * If an asset/process can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
          * Control is the regulation of access to assets.
	    * If an asset/process is changed without permission.
	      * Integrity is keeping assets undamaged and unaltered.
	    * If an asset/process becomes unavailable.
	      * Availability is the assurance that assets are available to parties authorized to use them.
        * If an asset/process becomes unreliable.
          * Consistency is when assets behave and work as expected, all the time.
	  * Determining Severity
	    * Identifying Consequence & Severity
		  * Taking list of consequences of the various risks applied to the assets/process' and ranking them from lease severe to most severe.
		    * This is used to create the risk assessment matrix in the report.
		* Identify what they are already doing to protect those assets/process' from those risks
		  * This can be technological as well as operational, procedural, etc.
