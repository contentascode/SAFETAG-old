### Discussion

Once the participants have all completed the first zenmap scans, ask the what they have found and discuss the information available not only in the conventient "Host Details" tab, but also the raw nmap output tab.  

 * Are there any interesting services available?
 * Any unexpected systems on the network?
 * What OSes are detected?
 * With the "outside" data from the Network Discover section, what more do you know about these devices and their owners?
