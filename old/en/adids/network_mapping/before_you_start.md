### Before You Start

While in the audit flow itself, these activities are closely linked together and part of the flow of the audit, training on this is likely to take multiple sessions:

  * Network Mapping and Service Discovery
    * Basic Network Mapping
    * Identifying Network Hardware
  * Network Traffic Analysis
  * Vulnerability Scanning
    * Using OpenVAS
    * Other tools
  * Vulnerability Research
    * Service Identification
    * Vulnerability Databases
    * Default Configurations

#### Preparing a Test Network

This session exposes the network being used to a variety of increasingly invasive scans. It is absolutely important to have a private network to run these scans on so as to not disrupt an actual network and in many cases cross potential legal lines.

In addition, it is very valuable to have "target" machines for the most invasive scans. Before you start the mapping exercises you will need to set up a laptop with multiple vulnerable virtual machines.  See the Materials Needed section for suggested VMs to use.
