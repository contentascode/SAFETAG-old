### Why It Matters

Networks are living, evolving things, and it is rare to encounter an accurate and up-to-date network diagram. In the modern era of "BYOD" (Bring Your Own Device), networks are host not only to planned infrastructure and workstations, but smartphones, tablets, and even personal laptops.  The network mapping part of the SAFETAG audit takes a microscope to the network to explore forgotten servers and suspicious traffic, uncover "shadow" infrastructure usage (like Dropbox), and finally to discover vulnerabilities on the network.
