While SAFETAG aims to provide a wholistic approach to organizational security, social engineering attacks remain a top threat for targeted organizations, with companies producing specialized software systems for governments to use to infect organizations with malware.  Many aspects of the audit improve defenses around these, but the best defense is an informed user who has developed that special "6th sense" about suspicious emails and links.

An honest discussion about the risks inherent wth email attachments and browsing (especially if using an admin account) is important to have, and the exercises we suggest are useful starting off points.

It is rare when is not significant critical data on user devices, and critical processes would not be impacted if these devices were compromised, so creating buy-in for later recommendations (such as removing admin privileges) will be valuable.
