## What makes a SAFETAG Auditor?

SAFETAG Auditors combine many different skillsets, bridging deep technical knowledge, a rich understanding of digital security, and the ability to clearly communicate these often byzantine and complex concepts to non-technical colleagues.

On top of this, for a successful SAFETAG audit, the auditors must be absolutely trusted by the organizations they are supporting, which often requires tight networks of trust and referral among regional and local communities of practice.  The auditor should understand the threat landscape the organization is facing.

### Team Audits

Ideally, every SAFETAG audit would be done by two auditors in tandem.  This accelerates the audit process, and allows one auditor to focus more on the technical side, and one providing more of the facilitation skills, working with the organization on process mapping.

The reality of digital security audits in the non-profit world, much like trainings, is that often only one auditor will be able to go, so the technical auditor should be able to do the more facilitation-style work, and the more facilitator/process focused auditor should be able to work through the technical audit side as well.  With two people, the audit can move much faster.

Currently, we are seeking to find regionally based digital security experts who are well versed in not only the security landscapes of their region, but are part on networks of trust among organizations, enabling organizations who simply don't have trusted links up to global organizations to benefit from this, while also enabling the regional auditors to further strengthen the audit process.
