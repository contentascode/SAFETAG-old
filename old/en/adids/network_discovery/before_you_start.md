### Before You Start

  * Pre-configure a wireless access point to serve WEP and WPA networks, and enable WPS for WPA. The WPA password should be quickly crackable based on the password attacks above. The WEP network should be configured to use 64 bit encryption to speed the practice. 
  * If no WEP network is available, you can use [this pre-build airodump-ng capture file](http://download.aircrack-ng.org/wiki-files/other/test.ivs) and skip the airodump-ng capture.
  * If no WPA network is available, you can use [this file](http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=wpa-Induction.pcap).
