### Discussion

 
Elevation of Privilege (EoP) often takes up the entire length of the time allotted and includes interesting discussions of its own. If time remains after the game, trainers may wish to have participants sit in a circle or semicircle, so they can address one another. The following questions may help start the discussion.

  * Would you  swap the order of any threats depending upon the process, needs, or risk model of an organization you were auditing? If so, how would you use process, needs, or risk models to prioritize threats/vulnerabilities to search for?
  
  * Elevation of Privilege (EoP) is based on Microsoft's STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege) threat framework. Are there other frameworks participants have used for exploring threat categorization?
