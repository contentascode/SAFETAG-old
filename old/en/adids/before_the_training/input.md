### Input


#### Logistics ####

* Venue: You'll want a private room large enough for the number of trainees.  A projector, TV or other large external screen is often useful, and a whiteboard or flipcharts are key.
* Travel: double-check on visa requirements 
* Lodging and ground transit: make sure you and the trainees understand how to get from the airport to the hotel, and where to gather on the first day.
* Food: having breakfast and lunch catered or provided/delivered can reduce complications / late starts
* Dinners/post-training: while everyone will want a break from each other afterwards, having a few planned but informal dinners or happy hours can help surface issues or places for deeper discussion that don't come up during the training.

#### Schedule ####

Below is a sample training schedule that has evolved out of the experience thus far with training on SAFETAG.  There is a lot of content to cover, but that has to be regulated by not having a training that is simply too long.

#### Trainees,  and Pre-tests and homework ####

Pre-tests are ways to try and make sure your trainees have a base skill level to be able to not only absorb, but responsibly use the SAFETAG material.  This is an area of active discussion and development in the SAFETAG community, but currently, having trainees who use Linux as their daily operating system or who are extremely familiar with it, and who are comfortable and accustomed to using PGP for communications seems to be a good start.

Homework assignments are listed in the Deepening section, below, and are useful to further prepare your trainees and to get some of the slower exercises and tasks out of the way.
