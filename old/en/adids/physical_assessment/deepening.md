If time permits, the SaferJourno curricula has an extensive Deepening section, but for most auditors the Activity/Input/Discussion suffices.  

Make note of discussing with the auditors tips on: 

 * Integrating physical assessment steps throughout the audit process, particularly during the User Device Assessment
 * Empathy
 * Capturing Data without alienating yourself
 * Writing up Findings
 * Connecting to Assets revealed through network mapping and the Process Mapping work
