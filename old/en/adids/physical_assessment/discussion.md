### Discussion

Frequently, the Risk Hunting activity (above) leads to an extended discussion on its own when teams take turns presenting their findings. However, if time remains, trainers may wish to have participants sit in a circle or semicircle, so they can address one another. The following questions may help start the discussion.

As always, trainers should encourage each person to speak up. It is likely that some have thought carefully about the issues; others may not have thought too much. This exercise will likely reveal some interesting practices, which makes for a rich discussion.

  * Did anything in the exercise remind you of something you have seen at the host organization?
  *  Did it look similar? Very different? In what ways?
  * Did anything in the exercise remind you of your office or your workspace?
  * Why do you think risks like these are common in newsrooms or workspaces?
  * Do you think these risks only affect the person using the workspace or would other people in the office be affected by these risks? How?
  * What kinds of risks are present in public spaces? Do you see similar issues in IT cafes, for instance?
  * Do you know of examples where:
    * Someone's personal safety was compromised? Do you know what happened?
    * Someone's property or data was compromised? How did that happen?
    * What kinds of precautions do you take to protect your physical safety or the safety of your work?
