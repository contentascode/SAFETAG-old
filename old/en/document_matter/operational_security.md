## Operational Security


"*Also be aware that local groups may not be able to accurately gauge the safety of their communications with you. Sometimes they underestimate the likelihood of risk - at other times, they can wildly overestimate the risk. Either way, trainers need to navigate this issues carefully and respectfully with a "do no harm" approach that respects the reported needs, context, and experiences of your local contact and potential trainees.*" - _Needs Assessment: Level-Up_ [^event_planning_input]

### Summary

Below are the baseline operational security guidelines for a SAFETAG audit. Activity specific operational security guidelines are contained within each activity.

### Purpose

An audit uncovers an array of sensitive information about an organization. For some at-risk populations the mere act of getting a digital security audit can increase their likelihood of being actively attacked by an adversary. The foundation of the SAFETAG process is the goal of increasing the safety of the host organization, its staff, and the auditor. It is vital that an auditor weigh the possible risk and audit may incur on the organization or the auditor against the possible outcomes of an audit.

### Objectives

  * Data storage security
    * Keep ALL data related to the audit secured per the [Pentest Standards for data security](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement#PGP_and_Other_Alternatives), from interview and research notes through audit findings and reporting outputs. Additional notes per section.

  * Communications security
    * Conduct all communication with the client over at least minimally secure channels where the communication is encrypted in transit at all times per the [Pentest Standards for data security](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement#PGP_and_Other_Alternatives).
    * Higher levels of security (such as PGP, truecrypt, or minilock) should be used for all file and document transfers.
