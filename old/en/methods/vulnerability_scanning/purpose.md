It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to outsource most of its IT infrastructure to a cloud provider, such as Google Apps, or to ad-hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, etc.). A better-resourced organization may be more likely to host its critical services at a remote data center, but not have someone designated to update and patch systems as vulnerabilities are released, or to view the services from a security -- as opposed to availability -- standpoint.
