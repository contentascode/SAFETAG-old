  * Determine the security of the wireless access point (WAP).
  * Gain client access to the WAP.
  * Test unused ethernet ports for live network connectivity.

*Note*: If you didn't manage to break through the password, it's not worth the precious audit time to brute force it - simply ask for the password and move on.  If it's a WPA network, you can work on cracking the password after hours, if only to demonstrate the amount of time their current password would "protect" them for against a dedicated attacker.
