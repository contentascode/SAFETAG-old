# The Remote Assessment

The remote assessment methodology focuses on direct observation of an organization and their infrstructure. This methodology uses "Open Source Inteligence" to gather as much information as the auditor can about an organization. This information is used to inform many of the following sections. Sometimes this is referred to as “preliminary reconnaissance” or “open source information gathering.”

This Section:
  * does not require privileged access to the organization’s offices, infrastructure or staff;

  * relies primarily on third-party data sources and observation and light probing of the organization’s infrastructure;

  * can generally be carried out from any secure Internet connection;

  * is largely concerned with gathering information that you will use in later stages of the assessment; and

  * does not focus on identifying of vulnerabilities; but

  * may nonetheless expose certain threats, particularly with regard to publicly-accessible information that is presumed to be confidential, such as the identity of sensitive staff, the existence of sensitive partner- and funder-relationships, or the organization’s history of participation in sensitive events or travel to sensitive locations.
