### Vulnerability: Unencryped Email connections

A common issue with e-mail services is the lack of proper encryption. Staff should only be allowed to connect to the organization’s mail server using SSL or TLS encryption. 

When a staff member sends or receives email an attacker with access to the same local network can easily and invisibly read, record, or modify all messages in-transit to and from the organization’s mail server.

Even an informed staff member who attempts to configure his email client to require SSL or TLS encryption will be unable to do so because the mail server does not support it.
