Identifying the processes that allow the organization to function (publishing, payment, fund-raising, outreach, interviewing) the assets and systems (websites, software, PayPal) they rely on, and which ones are critical to their work. (Activity)

 "Paranoia knows no bounds. There has to be a delicate balance between internet security and common sense. Excess security will hamper trust between communicating parties and increase frustration. Internet security is a must but not when it threatens relationships." - [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/hacking-surrveillance-ngo-protect-online-security)



Participants are asked to "brain-storm" a list of all the processes that are critical for their work. The auditor gives the participants a few example processes for a small independant media outlet.

  * News gathering
  * Editing
  * Publishing
  * User Feedback
  * Lead Development
  * Paying Staff
  * Getting Advertisers
  * Collecting Payment from Advertisers

Once the participants have brainstormed these out the facilitator leads the participants in identifying the critical processes (this may be all of the processes identified.)

* News gathering
  * Editing
  * Publishing
  * Lead Development
  * Paying Staff

The trainer then begins a free-hand process mapping activity for each process. You will be "charting the sequence of events of the work." 

A Process Map shows

  * The people involved;  * The tasks, conversations, and decisions they carry out;
  * The flow of materials, information and documents between them;
  * The relationship and dependance between the steps.


##### Materials Needed

  * post-it notes
  * White-board or large paper sheet


##### How to make a process map

######  

This process map will be used to develop our asset map.

"Draw the flowchart initially to represent the operation, as it actually happens - NOT what you might prefer it to be! Use a flip chart or whiteboard to produce your initial charts"

    "WHO does WHAT (Job title/Function e.g. Level A1)
    WHAT is done and WHEN
    What DECISIONS have to be taken and
    What possible paths follow from each decision"

Keep it simple to facilitate broad understanding of the OVERALL process. Too much detail early on can be overwhelming and/or lead to confusion. If you agree that more detail is required on a particular action, it is easy to highlight that box and produce a separate chart showing the process taking place within.
