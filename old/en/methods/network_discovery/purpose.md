The value of the network discovery component depends on the risk assessment of the organization. In many cases, an organization may not want the name of their wireless network to be associated with to their organization. 

Device beacons are also of interest, as they can reveal organizational links, as well as travel, favorite hotspots, and more.  Beacons can "de-anonymize" an obfuscated network name as well as provide rich content for social engineering attacks. This provides an only-lightly-invasive introduction to discuss the trackability of devices, particularly mobiles and laptops.

Wireless networks are often trusted as equivalent to the hardwired office networks they have largely replaced, but they have important differences. Wireless networks are often "visible" from outside the walls of the office - from common spaces or even the street. Without further access, this step along reveals a wealth of information about the organization's size and the type of devices connecting to their network.
