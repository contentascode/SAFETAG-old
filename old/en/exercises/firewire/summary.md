Firewire ports and expansion slots can be abused to obtain data that are thought to be encrypted

Any attacker who obtains a running (including sleeping and hibernating!) Windows, Mac, or even Linux laptop with a Firewire port, an ExpressCard expansion slot, or a Thunderbolt port will be able to read, record or modify any sensitive information on the device, even if the screen is “locked” and the information is stored on an encrypted volume or in an encrypted folder. This applies to threats involving loss, theft and confiscation, but also to “checkpoint” scenarios in which the attacker may only have access for a few minutes.

This attack requires physical control of a machine that is not powered off. Full details of the scope of the attack are available at http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/ .
