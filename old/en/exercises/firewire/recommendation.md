**Remove FireWire Drivers, completely turn off computer when at risk**

The easiest protection against this is to completely shut down your computer any time there is a chance of confiscation, and to make this a regular practice at night and when traveling.

If possible, the best protection against this is to remove or disable the SBP-2 and the FireWire drivers (Windows: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2516445 , Linux: http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/physical-memory-attacks-via-firewire-dma-part-1-overview-and-mitigation) . For Mac, upgrading to the most recent operating system (but at least 10.7.2/Lion!).
