### Weak Passwords

Weak and "shared" passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, "password" and "12345" remain the most popular passwords. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.
