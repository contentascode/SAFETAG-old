This activity helps to identify the processes that allow the organization to function (publishing, payment, fund-raising, outreach, interviewing) the assets and systems (websites, software, PayPal) they rely on, and which ones are critical to their work. (Activity)

Participants are asked to "brain-storm" a list of all the processes that are critical for their work and the auditor works to map the details of critical processes out to expose points of risk.
