The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in "brain-storming" and mapping all the processes that are critical for the organization to carry out their work.


##### Additional Material

  * Chart Paper or whiteboard.
  * Marker pens or whiteboard markers.

#### Getting Started


The auditor gives the participants a few example processes for a small independent media outlet.

  * News gathering
  * Editing
  * Publishing
  * User Feedback
  * Lead Development
  * Paying Staff
  * Getting Advertisers
  * Collecting Payment from Advertisers

Once the participants have brainstormed these out the facilitator leads the participants in identifying the critical processes (this may be all of the processes identified.)

* News gathering
  * Editing
  * Publishing
  * Lead Development
  * Paying Staff

The trainer then begins a free-hand process mapping activity for each process. You will be "charting the sequence of events of the work." 

A Process Map shows

  * The people involved;  * The tasks, conversations, and decisions they carry out;
  * The flow of materials, information and documents between them;
  * The relationship and dependance between the steps.


#### Conducting the Activity


  * **List all organizational processes:** The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in "brain-storming" a list of all the processes the organization takes part in to carry out their work. It is important to remember this is a brainstorming session of all of the processes that occur in the organization.

    * Quickly identify the main purpose of the organization. If the organization is an online newspaper, the purpose then is to create, distribute, and diversify the content they are providing to their consumers.

    * Write out the list of all the processes that would occur in a very busy week at the office. This is a brainstorming session with your participants so it is important to get them to identify as many different processes at the beginning.

    * Once a complete list has been created, the auditor will then go through through to identify with the participants the critical processes within the organization – that is, without these processes the organization would not be able to function or function at a very poor level

  * **Determine critical processes:** During this exercise the aim is for the auditor to lead the attendees in narrowing down the subset of activities to those that are crucial to their work.

    * step 1
    * step 2
    * step 3
    * step etc.

*NOTE:* If an auditor does not ensure that the uniquely identified subset of processes speaks to the full range of participants, their recommendations are more likely to be met with resistance.

  * **Map out critical processes:** In this exercises the auditor does free-hand mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The auditor needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.

    * Clearly identify the process name on the whiteboard or flipchart
	* Identify the first and last steps from the participants and write them on the side of the paper to keep the participants on track.
	* Place the "Starting" place on the white paper.
	* Have your participants explain to you what the process is step-by-step, while making a note on the side where there will be follow on processes.
      1. Don’t forget about follow-on processes
      2. List who does each step along side each process
    * Verbally walk the participants through the completed process so you ensure you didn’t miss anything
	* Take quick notes to remind yourself of any key points not clearly marked on the map before they move on to the next activity. 
	* After completing all the key events take a photo of the whiteboard / store the chart-paper for later documentation.

While doing this it is important to consider level of detail you will be mapping out (this should be pre-determined or established so everyone is on the same page)



##### How to make a process map

This process map will be used to develop our asset map.

"Draw the flowchart initially to represent the operation, as it actually happens - NOT what you might prefer it to be! Use a flip chart or whiteboard to produce your initial charts"

    "WHO does WHAT (Job title/Function e.g. Level A1)
    WHAT is done and WHEN
    What DECISIONS have to be taken and
    What possible paths follow from each decision"

Keep it simple to facilitate broad understanding of the OVERALL process. Too much detail early on can be overwhelming and/or lead to confusion. If you agree that more detail is required on a particular action, it is easy to highlight that box and produce a separate chart showing the process taking place within.
