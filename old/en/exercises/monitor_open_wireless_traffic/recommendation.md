#### Recommendation: Cleanse wifi network connection history

For most devices, deleting networks from the “saved” network list will stop them from being probed. Obviously, this can be an annoyance for networks you regularly connect to, so renaming these networks to non-revealing names would help, as would creating non-name-associated “guest” networks for colleagues connecting to your home network.

Making sure that mobile hotspots/tethers do not broadcast your name is useful for many reasons.

On iPhones and iPads, it is not possible to selectively remove historical networks unless you are currently in range of that network.

It is however possible to remove all history: go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings . When you take this step, it is worth going through this reset multiple times – approximately once per year of device ownership, as the first reset appears to only remove recently-connected networks, and older networks will be broadcast.
