Each wireless device maintains a "memory" of what networks it has successfully connected to. When it is connecting to a network, it sends out "probes" to all of the networks it has in this memory. These probes can reveal personal, organizational, and locational information that, taken in context, can be dangerous or lead to other vulnerabilities.

It is important to note that this data gets broadcast widely, and can be collected without any network access, only proximity to the device.
Description

Before attempting to gain internal access to the wireless network, it can be valuable to to listen to the wireless traffic as close to the physical office location as possible, even without knowing anything about the network itself. This outside, passive information gathering can reveal a surprising amount of data on not only what devices are connecting to which networks, but also what type of devices they are (based on their unique MAC addresses), and what other networks those devices have historically connected to.

These network probes can often contain names (especially from mobile phone tethers), organizational affiliations, and a mixture of other potentially valuable data (home network names, recent airports, caf√©s and conference networks). If there are many networks in the office's vicinity, this will help identify the specific office network (if there is any doubt).
