SAFETAG SOW

Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment using the SAFETAG framework, to include these core methods:

* Organizational technology capacity assessment
* Sensitive data and/or process mapping 
* Analysis of operational and technical vulnerabilities
* Threat actor and context research
* Creating with the organization and agreed-upon ranking of risks based on the above processes

For each method, the auditor is expected to combine research, interaction with key staff members, larger facilitated exercises, and where appropriate, technical verifications/investigations to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the organization's potential risks.
