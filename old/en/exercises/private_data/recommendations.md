For the internal audit report back to the organization, much of the information will require specific identification of user devices (and by extension, their users), as well as very sensitive organizational data. None of this data, by intention, accident, or adversarial action, should be shared with third parties. 

Please refer to the Analysis and Reporting section for the limited data set that is required for project reporting, and to the Operational Security section for guidance on data security.
