#### Recommendation: 

Social Engineering and Phishing - especially highly targeted ones - are incredibly difficult to detect in "real life," but reducing your reliance on attachments, being careful when opening links, and using tools (from your email client to your document tools and web browser) which add layers of protection (by being up to date, by not running as admin, by having script/plugin-blocking turned on) all help.

Using third party services to open and view documents provides yet another "trick" to block unwelcome attachments.
