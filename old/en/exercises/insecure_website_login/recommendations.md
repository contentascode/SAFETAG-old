HTTPS / SSL – this comes at a cost, both the SSL Certificate and often an upgrade to the hosting plan itself. However, without SSL, every password – including the one used for admin access to the website – goes across the Internet in the clear. This is immediately available to a state-level actor through the ISP, and can also be sniffed if accessed by a staff member on a shared wifi connection (at a coffeeshop or airport), and finally if the attacker has broken in to the office network (see the Local Access section). Enabling SSL (and making it the default for your site) also protects the users of your site.

If an organization updates their website via FTP, it is worth noting that FTP is similarly insecure. Many hosting providers provide SFTP or FTPS, (two different, but secure, FTP versions), or secure WebDAV to upload files. These should be used, turning “plain” FTP off altogether if possible.

When switching to SSL/Secure FTP after having used the plain versions, webmasters should also update all administrative passwords, and watch to make sure that no step along the way (hosting provider management/panel, file upload, CMS editing) goes over “clear” channels.
