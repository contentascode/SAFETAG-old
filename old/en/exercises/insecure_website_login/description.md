Without SSL security, any malicious actor on the same network, and any actor at the ISP or government level, could intercept this traffic and capture the administrative password easily. Further, without SSL, it is trivial for these same actors to intercept traffic intended for your website and capture user logins and profile information.

For websites which are updated through FTP, FTP is similarly insecure.
