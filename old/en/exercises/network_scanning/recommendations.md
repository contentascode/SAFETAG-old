While office networks are often treated as "trusted" spaces, measures should be in place to reduce the potential harm of an attacker who gains access.  In addition, devices that "travel" -- such as laptops and mobile phones -- should have adequate security settings (generally, firewalls) to protect them on other networks.

A policy should be in place for connecting personal devices to work networks, as well as work devices to non-work networks.
