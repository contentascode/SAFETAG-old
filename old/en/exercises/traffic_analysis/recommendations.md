Only use services with ["SSL" encryption](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication) ("HTTPS"), and consider adding [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to browsers. This does not itself guarantee protection from all attacks, but it is a good first-step in protecting information (such as passwords or email) in transit from your computer to the service provider.
