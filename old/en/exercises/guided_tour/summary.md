The physical assessment methodology is focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world. 

The assessment uses a walkthrough and interview methodology to answer the following questions:

  * How are daily devices used and stored?
  * Where are they when employees go home?
  * Are there active network jacks that are unused, are they in public spaces, are they in places where people would not notice if there was somthing plugged into them?
  * How are backups managed? Where are they stored?
  * Where are the servers and network components that host and manage the organizations assets?
  * Who has independent access to the office space?
