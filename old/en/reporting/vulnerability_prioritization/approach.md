Vulnerability prioritization is a critical process. It is vital that the reasoning an auditor uses during this stage are documented and available within the report. If an auditor does not create accurate associations between the host identified impact or uses an inaccurate assessment of adversary capabilities it can lessen the credibility of the recommendations made.

  * Identify vulnerabilities environment and impact (per vulnerability)
    * Identify the possible impact of the vulnerability.
      * Identify any threats to critical process' the vulnerability makes possible.
	  * Identify the process with the greatest impact if interrupted.
    * Identify the possibility of exploitation.
	  * Identify the level of resources required to exploit the vulnerability.
	  * Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed. 
    * Position the vulnerability on the risk matrix in relation to its likelihood and its impact.
