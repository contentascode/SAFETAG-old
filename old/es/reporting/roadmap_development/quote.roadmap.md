"*When you are developing your security plans, consider how elements of acceptance, protection and deterrence can expand the menu of options you have at your disposal.*

The risk of individual security plans is that they become personal good intentions that get thrown out when things are hectic.*"- _Workbook on Security: Practical Steps for Human Rights Defenders at Risk_ [^workbook_on_security]
