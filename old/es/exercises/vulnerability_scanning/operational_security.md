* Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.
* OpenVAS saves its scan records in /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db - this file will contain sensitive data, ensure it is stored securely.
* OpenVAS and other vulnerability scanners can be highly aggressive in their tactics.  Tools like Metasploit come with a library of active, functional exploits to "prove" that a system is actively vulnerable.  As such, these can be tricky to use.  Even OpenVAS on a safe-only scan can appear to a host as an active attack, blocking further access from your IP (this can cause some annoyance if you are, for example, scanning your host organization's website from their network).  Some of these scans and techniques -- again, even the "safe" ones -- can also be a violation of local hacking laws.  Get explicit permission, give warnings, and be careful.
