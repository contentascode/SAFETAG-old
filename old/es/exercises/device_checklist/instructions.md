The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work & personal).  The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what "red flags" they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.

See the Appendix for a per-OS guide of where to find key data.
