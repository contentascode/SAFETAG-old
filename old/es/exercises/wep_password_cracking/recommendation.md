#### Recommendation: Upgrade to WPA2 Encryption

WEP provides no effective protection for a wifi network. Most wifi routers offer WPA encryption as an option, and if this is available it should be immediately implemented. Some older routers (and wifi devices) do not support WPA. It is highly recommended to upgrade immediately to hardware that supports WPA and to eliminate all WEP network access. Very few devices still functional do not support WPA2.
