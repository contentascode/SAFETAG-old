Laptops, workstations, servers, external hard drives, and backup systems should be configured to use some form of hard drive encryption.

  * For Windows, Microsoft BitLocker is built in to the latest versions, free-of-charge for anyone with a valid Windows 7 “Ultimate” license or Windows 8.

  * For Apple OSX users, FileVault2 is a built-in alternative that is also free-of-charge.
  
  * TrueCrypt is a cross-platform solution that is open source and free of charge, and can work on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines as well.

All three solutions provide a way to encrypt data on internal drives as well as external hard drives, and USB memory sticks.
