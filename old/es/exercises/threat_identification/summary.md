These activities build off of a process or data mapping exercise to connect actual processes or assets and data of the organization with potential threats, then drilling down into specific, likely threats the organization faces, adversaries who might take advantage of them, and the impact of this happening.

The goal is to be able to answer the following questions: 

**Threat History**

* What history of attacks does the threat actor have?
* What techniques have they used? Have they targeted vulnerabilities that the organization currently has?
* What is known about the types of threats used by an threat actor to attack similar organizations?

**Threat Capability**

* Does the threat actor have the means to exploit a vulnerability that the organization currently has?
* Does the threat actor have the means to leverage widespread threats against all similar organizations, or will they have to prioritize their targets?

**Threat Intent**

* Have they targeted similar organizations?
* Does the threat actor currently have the desire to conduct an attack against this type of organization?
* Is the organization a priority threat target for the threat actor?
