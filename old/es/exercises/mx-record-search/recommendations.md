No fix needed

Unless other assessments reveals specific vulnerabilities in e-mail services used, there is no action to take. Unless you have sufficient in-house expertise, it is often recommended to not host email servers. While self-hosted email provides more control and potentially security, managing the security of the server is a complex job. Other mail services, such as MailControl or Postini, also can provide some level of protection by being a first-pass check for spam and viruses, and (slightly) reducing the visibility of your organizational mail server.
