Local networks often have a variety of devices connected to them - servers, user devices, staff cellphones, and more.  Scanning the connected devices can reveal potential areas for further research (odd ports being open, out of date devices/services, forgotten servers/services...).

Selected scanning of external network devices (websites, webmail, extranet services) may also reveal vulnerabilities or other areas of concern.
