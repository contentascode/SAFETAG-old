Open and MAC-address-filtered wireless access points are not only open to anyone within range to join and listen in to, but also do not provide protection to those on the network itself, even if they do not "broadcast" their name.  These may seem like great ways to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your network without resorting to passwords, but they are trivial to overcome.
