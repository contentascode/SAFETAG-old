**Personal Information To Keep Private**

Information that can be used to identify individuals, organizations, and even communities of practice should be treated with the utmost care. Some data, like names, phone numbers, and addresses are obvious, while others, like computer names, the MAC addresses of wifi cards, or pseudonymous social media accounts may be less obvious. Also, combinations of information - location, data, and type of activity, or even an issue area of interest and a city name may specify a very small number of activists or organizations.

This spreadsheet, part of the [Responsible Data Forum documentation sprint](https://wiki.responsibledata.io/RDF_Budapest) provides a useful baseline of types of data and ways to manage or obfsucate it usefully:  [Data Anonymization Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qf90P7dlXL6bwfG9vDpapQe1HUD1PtCqjJwayn0xOkQ/edit?usp=sharing)
