**Step 1 : Guided Tour**

As part of your first day, have your point of contact walk you around the office - this is primarily a chance to understand the office layout and meet the rest of the staff, but take mental note of the devices in use and laying out on desks as you walk around the office.  Note as well the location and access to components such as servers and networking components.

  * Device usage and storage,
  * Sensitive information or external storage drives lying on desks,
  * Accounts/passwords written on post-its, white-boards, etc.,
  * Unattended, logged in computers,
  * Unlocked cabinets, computer rooms, or wiring closets.

Taking actual notes may make the staff feel that you are judging them, so refrain from this if possible, especially if this is your first interaction.

**Step 2 : Access Policies**

Working with your POC and other relevant staff (administrative/operational staff, IT staff), enumerate list of everyone who has independent access to the office space, and routine after-hours access (i.e. who is able to unlock the space).  This may include cleaning or other service personnel.  Shared office spaces present unique challenges, and access policies and procedures for the building housing the office may also become relevant.

**Step 3 : (Optional) After Ours Walk-Through**

Also schedule a time with your primary point of contact to visit the office when all (or at least most) staff are not present.  This could be before the staff arrives in the morning, or after hours (perhaps have dinner with your POC, and come back to check the organization afterwards). Other significantly less ideal options could be during a lunch break or a meeting when the staff are offsite or in a conference room.

During this time, go back through the office (taking notes for the audit this time) to see how devices are outside of the work day (are desktops and laptops unsecured, still on, logged in?).  Are backup drives or other storage media easily accessible? Are doors to server rooms/closets locked?  Are keys to these locked cabinets/rooms visible?

Also note and test network ports that are not in use, looking especially for ones which are not in plain sight.
