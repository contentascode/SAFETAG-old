An activity focused on raising "security awareness."

And remember, whatever play-by-play threat scenarios you present in your report need not rise to the level of “journalism.” They are more like allegories. So, if you are given a “tip,” or some level of privileged access, that leads you to a vulnerability, you can often work backward from there to create a credible scenario in which some attacker (perhaps one with more time or expertise than you yourself have) arrives at the same destination, but without “cheating.” This is not only legitimate, it is an excellent technique.
