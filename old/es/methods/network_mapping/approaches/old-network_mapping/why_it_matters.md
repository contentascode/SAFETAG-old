### why the topic matters

A surprisingly common response from IT administrators, when confronted with a significant local vulnerability, is something like, “Sure but that’s all inside the firewall, right?” Often, this statement is technically correct—that is, after all, the point of a firewall—but one hears this even from staff who are well aware that their wireless password is the name of the organization.

Perimeter defenses protect staff workstations and smartphones, sure, but they also represent the only obstacle between an attacker and a point-of-presence on an organization’s LAN that would allow him or her to sniff the organization’s unencrypted traffic.

<!-- TODO finish this paragraph that describes why traffic analysis is the method used to address this common misconception.-->
Traffic analysis allows you to [be the attacker]
