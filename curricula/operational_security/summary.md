### Summary 
Researching and establishing your practices for operational security not only improve your own security, but also protect the organization and their  most sensitive digital assets and vulnerabilities. It is important not only to have your own physical and digital security practices up to the task, but to make sure that your points of contact with the organization are also able to interact securely with you.
