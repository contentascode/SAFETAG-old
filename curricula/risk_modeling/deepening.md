### Deepening

The goal of this activity is to give the trainees an opportunity to lead an opportunity to build upon the process mapping activity and build out a full risk assessment.

#### Identify threats to processes.

This short exercise is not as interactive for the host organizations participants as many in this section, and as such can be more difficult for a trainee who is less comfortable lecturing to groups.

  * Identify Current Approaches to addressing risks
    * Identify the warning's, notices, status indicators, training, and policies that already exist to address these risks.
	* *NOTE:* We do this so that we can anchor proposed action in existing practices in the report. - (Shostack: Threat Modeling pg. 298)


#### Identify the impact to the organization if those threats occur.

This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences when certain risks occur to the process' and actions identified earlier.

*NOTE {.note}* It can be easy for a group to get distracted arguing over the likelihood of certain risks over others. The trainer may need to assist the trainee in re-focusing the group. If this happens, the trainer should make a note of it and go over techniques for managing these kinds of brainstorms with a large group.

  * Give participants a cheat sheet of risks.
  * Pick a "data flow" on a process map and give it a number. On a big piece of butcher paper, or a white board the trainer writes the number and the risks for that data flow. 
  * The trainer has the participants give examples of actual risks that follow the risk types and the consequences for the risks along that data flow.
  * The trainer writes the applied risks and their consequences on post-its and places them under each category. 
    * Write risks on one set of post-its and consequences on another color of post it's.
  * If multiple risks cause the same consequence create a new post-it near the new risk.
  * Continue doing this for all the data flows in the critical process'.
  * If any of the risks or consequences identified in the pre-mortum are not covered ask participants where they would go. 
  * Take photos of the risks and consequences once you have finished enumerating them.


The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in classifying the severity of the possible consequences from the risks they have just explored. 

  * Places two end points on the wall. On one side are "Inconvenient" consequences that disrupt the organization in a very small way. For example, a fire alarm may cause the staff to lose a half an hour of work time, but does not impact any short or long-term activities. On the other side are "critical" consequences that may pose life-safety risks to employee's, partners, or the general public. 
  * Asks the participants to prioritize the risks based upon the level of impact the threat could have. For example, earthquakes are potentially devastating (critical.)  And, having the trainer move the risk to a place on the wall that reflects that severity.
  * As consequences are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked consequences to help participants identify the right place. "Is another news organization publishing a story before us more or less severe than losing a long-term insider source?"
  * Take photos of the severity scale to record it for later.


#### Identify adversaries (people or groups) who may attempt to carry out threats and their capabilities

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in estimating the likelyhood of the risk occurring on various time-scales.

  * Place two end points on the wall. On one side "certain" attacks that the participants know will happen. For example, knowing that robberies will happen because the organization has been robbed multiple times in the past few years. On the other side "limited" events that the participants believe are less likely to occur than to not occur. For example, an earthquake in an area where one has never historically occurred.
  * Asks the participants to prioritize the risks based upon the likelyhood of each risk. For example, earthquakes may be rare in some regions (low likelyhood.) And having the trainer move the risk to a place on the wall that reflects that likelyhood.
  * As risks are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked risks to help participants identify the right place. "Is a robbery more or less likely than a fire?"
  * Take photos of the likelyhood scale to record it for later.


#### Create a risk matrix placing impacts against a range of likelihood
