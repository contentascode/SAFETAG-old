#### Risk Hunting

This activity invites participants to explore a mock room or a “risky space” (a place that has been set aside in the training venue, or a separate room) to identify potential risks to equipment and data. In this activity, the space is prepared in advance and the trainer will keep a list of risks that have been intentionally left for participants to find.

#### Preparation

Prior to the start of the class, the trainer prepares the “risky space” with several risks left intentionally visible. These might include:

  * A network jack with a ethernet cable hanging out with nothing attached. (suggestive of a live network jack.)
  * Open windows.
  * Door with key hanging from the lock.
  * Laptop(s) without a locking cable on a desk.
  * Open desk drawers, with an external hard drive sticking out.
  * Passwords written on a “sticky note” or other paper taped to a monitor or onto the surface of a desk.
  * A flash drive, left in a computer’s USB socket.
  * Computer left unattended with active Outlook, Gmail, Skype or other communication application open and visible.

NOTE: This is only a list of a suggestions. This can be modified to fit the requirements of the participants and a risky habit practiced by participants that trainers want to draw attention to.

##### ADDITIONAL MATERIALS: {.sidebar}

  * Chart paper.
  * Marker pens.
  * A dedicated space that can serve as the “risky space.”
  * Equipment and furniture that can be used in the “risky space.”
	
*NOTE:*{.note} It is not essential that furniture match the work spaces of participants, but the closer to an authentic work space, the more effective the activity is likely to be.

#### Conducting the Activity

At the start of the exercise, the trainer explains that the purpose of the module is to learn ways to identify how the physical location of digital assets increase or change risks to organizations and their electronic devices.

  * Invites participants to walk up to or around the prepared space (or view a prepared photograph) for five minutes and take notes of risks they see.
  * Organizes participants into groups of two or three and asks them to work together to share their findings with each other, and to then take five minutes to write their observations on a sheet of chart paper.
  * Reminds participants that some “risks” will be obvious while others may not be obvious to all members in the group, and encourages discussion among participants to explore their views.
  * When 10 minutes are left in the activity, asks teams to take turns presenting their “risks list” and to explain why individual items on the list might create a risk.
  * Takes some time to point out any prepared risks that the group has not identified.

#### Alternatives

1. In cases where there is insufficient time or room to create the “risky space,” the trainer may
wish to substitute this activity with the “Day in the Life,” described at the LevelUp website.

2. In cases in which participants belong to the same media organization and the event takes
place at their office, trainers may prefer to divide the class into teams and ask participants to
assess their normal work surroundings. This encourages participants to look at familiar territory
in new ways and provides an immediate, practical benefit to the organizers of the event.
