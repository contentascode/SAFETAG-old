### Activity: Elevation of Privilege: The Threat Modeling Game

[Elevation of Privilege (EoP)](http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/adopt/eop.aspx) is a card game for 3-6 players that introduces Microsoft's STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege) threat framework. The purpose of this activity is to get participants excited about the creative exploration of vulnerabilities in a system.

#### Getting Started

  * The trainer should split the players into groups of 3-6.
  
  * One of the players will deal seven cards to each of the players.

#### Conducting the Activity

  * Play starts with the player who has the "3 of Tampering."

  * Play moves clockwise, and each player in turn follows in the suit if they have a card in the suit. If they don’t have that suit, they can play another suit.

  * To play a card, a player...
  
    * Reads the card
	
	* Announces the threat clearly. If playing against a system known to the players, the threat should include a concept of how it could be mitigated.

  * If the player can’t link the threat to the diagrammed system, play proceeds.

  * Once all players have had an opportunity to play a card the round ends.

  * The highest card played with an explanation in that round wins the hand, with Elevation of Privilege cards (with accompanying explanations) taking precedence over the highest card played in that suit. Only Elevation of Privilege (EoP) or the high card in the suit that started the round can win the round.

  * Take few minutes between hands to discuss threats.

  * In the event that a threat leads to an argument, the threat should resolve by asking the question: “Would we take an actionable bug, feature request or design change for that?” If the answer is yes, it is a real threat.

  * Questions that start with “There’s a way” should be read as “There’s a way...and here’s how... ”while questions that start with “Your code” should be read “The code we’re collectively creating...and here’s how.”
