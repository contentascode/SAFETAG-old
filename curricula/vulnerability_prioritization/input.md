### Input

The first step of the analysis process is mapping the vulnerabilities identified against the organization's risk matrix.  This should have produced a collection of ranked impacts and a degree of likelihood based on the adversary or adversaries the organization is concerned about.


Taking the ranked Impacts as one axis of a graph, we can then add an axis for severity and plot the specific vulnerabilities on the graph in terms of what impact the successful exploitation of that vulnerability would have on the organization, and how severe it is, combining not only likelihood but also the extent of the vulnerabilty)

Risk graphing:

This provides a very high-level overview of the vulnerabilities that the audit has revealed, graphed against their overall risk for the organization, showing a visual representation of this risk model equation

To map this out, work through each vulnerability:

 * Identify the vulnerability's possible impact to all identified critical processes
 * Identify the process with the greatest impact if interrupted.
 * Identify the vulnerability's severity and the resources required to exploit the vulnerability  (different metrics for assessing possibility  (CSSV, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0 , etc.))
 * Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed.
 * Position the vulnerability on the risk matrix in relation to its likelihood and its impact.
