### Input


#### Why interviews before the fact? ####
 
 * Auditor Preparation - knowing what you’re getting in to, both at the org and context levels
 * Value of regional auditors and local expertise (see also context research section)
 * Assessing an organization’s capacity and challenges
 * Filling in the blanks and finding policy/practice mismatches
 * Opsec drop out point? Secure communication?

#### Outputs #### 

**Organizational Capacity assessment**

Through the process of the interviews, you should be able to determine the answers to these questions

!INCLUDE "../../methods/capacity_assessment/guiding_questions.md"

**Specific outputs needed for audit**

The interviews should also uncover some specific initial targets for the remote audit and help prepare both you as an auditor and the organization as an auditee for the process.  See Appendix A for a list of specific outputs that other components of the audit presume are revealed through this process.

**Interview and Capacity Assessment Questions**

We include a series of interview questions to use as a guide, derived from the engine room's TechScape project (in Appendix A), and below are further references on the subject.

It is important to not "read from a list" and mechanically go through this in the interview process, however.  Know the outputs you need, use the methodology and paths outlined in the references, and have as organic a conversation as possible.  Particularly with the technical contact, they need to know that you are working with them and supporting them, as they may feel very vulnerable to the "audit" findings.
