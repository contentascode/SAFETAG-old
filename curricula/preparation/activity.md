### Activity

Energizer

To remind trainees of why preparation is useful, have each trainee note down on post-it notes some of their favorite worst disasters from their training and technology experiences, be they power outages, Internet failures, ants taking over key hardware, or natural disasters.  Gather these and group them into common categories, and discuss common problems as well as some of the more outlandish challenges encountered.
