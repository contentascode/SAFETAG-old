Introduction to Safetag Audit Reports
Description

SAFETAG is organized into categories, starting with information and vulnerabilities which are exploitable from remote locations, moving towards vulnerabilities which require increasingly more physical presence, listed below.

1. Research: The research component covers information and risks that can be discovered using free online search engines, as well as investigating websites and email. This may uncover semi-sensitive information that should not be public, as well as provide leads for further analysis.
2. Remote: This section goes into deeper detail on the findings revealed through the research phase, as well as further data points discussed with staff on the ground. This ensures remotely hosted services (hosted websites, email, extranets) are up to date and have secure connections.
3. Perimeter: Perimeter assessments focus on vulnerabilities which an adversary could exploit by being near the office (e.g. in a taxi idling in front of the office), but without entering the office or explicitly making themselves known. Much of this looks at the wireless network and best practices for security there.
4. Local: Local risks include challenges that become worrisome once a network has been compromised – to have a resilient “defense in depth” methodology, placing all your trust in any one part of an office (e.g. the firewall, or the wifi network password) is not enough. Ensuring on-network components are secured are just as important.
5. Physical Access: This component focuses on explicit risks of an adversary having in-person access (through a raid or theft, for example, but also confiscation of devices from staff at a border crossing). Unlike the previous components, the vulnerabilities discussed here cannot be exploited remotely.
6. Staff: This final section discusses risks both that an organization faces from staff, as well as risks specifically to staff, and how to best mitigate them.

This report only includes issues which were discovered as likely risks, so it is entirely possible to not have any issues on specific items in a section.
