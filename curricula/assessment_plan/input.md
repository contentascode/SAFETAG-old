### Input

You have had at least a brief discussion and done enough contextual research to be confident that the audit is safe for both you and the organization, and that you 
are both ready to move forward - Great!  It is now time to define the scope of the assessment, identifiy some key points of contact, and start working on the timeline to complete your interviews, conduct the remote audit sections, and plan any travel you may need.
 

 Initial scope setting

  * Clearly defining what is **not** included
  * Establish Auditee Consent

Points of contact

  * Who will your primary contact(s) be?  Will they be physically present during the audit?
  * Who is your primary technical contact?

Incident response plan

An incident repsonse plan that defines both what counts as an incident and how to respond to it is absolutely critical, you do **not** want to be guessing at process if you uncover - or cause - a situation needing immediate response.

 * What counts as an incident? (discovery of ...?)
 * What is the process if something goes wrong? (e.g. a scan appears to crash a server)


Timelines

  * Pre-audit Interviews
  * Remote assessment (remote scanning? Coordinate with tech contact)
  * In-country / in-office time and staff interaction needs
  * Debrief meeting
  * Post-audit timeline for reports and check-ins

Why a written form?

 * (Offline discussion)
