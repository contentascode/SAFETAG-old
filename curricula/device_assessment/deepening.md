### Deepening

If there are willing volunteers, ask one participant (or volunteer yourself) to role-play as a staff member, a second participant roleplay as "the computer", and another participant to lead a device assessment activity, asking the participant and "the computer" questions (they may not agree!)

The "auditor" should ask the "staff" first, "So, do you often run updates on your computer? Are they automatic?" -- and then ask the computer "Are you up to date?" 

Try and select participants who are comfortable at poking fun at themselves, or don't use a "computer" participant in the activity.
