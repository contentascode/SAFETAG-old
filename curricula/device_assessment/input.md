### Input

The Device Assessment portion of the audit is a rich source of information about daily practice, as opposed to policy.  The information from this exercise is as insightful, if not moreso, than the network scanning and mapping portions.  In a two-auditor setup, this is generally performed by the more "facilitator" style auditor.  In the case of a one-auditor process, it is a great exercise to interleave with other processes, and to do while running a slow scan on the network or simply capturing daily traffic.

It is best to do on the second or third day of the audit, balancing your familiarity to the staff with protecting your ability to react or dig deeper into information revealed during this.

Choose staff members strategically -- auditors do not need to check every computer at an organization (indeed, for larger ones, this will be impossible).  Auditors should select staff based on those represented in key organizational processes (from the process mapping work), those engaging with at-risk partners or topics, and executive leadership.

At its most basic, it is simply walking through a core checklist of security features on a selection of staff devices.  However, having a discussion with the staff member whose device you are working through about their practices (like how they check email/webmail, how they store files, if they take their laptop home at night...) provide fruitful information and a chance for some quick advice and information sharing.

Per each device, we check for:

 * OS Security Updates
 * Firewall
 * Anti-Virus Version
 * User privilege
 * Drive Encryption
 * Services Running

 The Guide example, "Device Checklist" has quick shortcuts to finding much of this information for each commonly found operating system.
